# EDD-Bed-Project
Year 4 (Engineering by Design and Development) Project of PLTW Engineering. Our team created a bed frame that was capable of moving a person awake based on limit switches and a motor with a speed controller. I was responsible for all programming and electrical engineering aspects.

Really I'm most proud I made a spinning bed.
